# Trying to blog with notebooks

Today I tried to set up the github pages blog to be able to blog with notebooks.
There's a [2020-01-26-bullet-chart-altair.ipynb](https://github.com/cast42/cast42.github.io/blob/master/_notebooks/2020-01-26-bullet-chart-altair.ipynb) 
in the [_notebooks](https://github.com/cast42/cast42.github.io/blob/master/_notebooks/) directory but I does not generate a post yet.

I keep on debugging.

I appears that you have to add '/sync' to commit message.

At least the convertion process has triggered: [https://github.com/cast42/cast42.github.io/runs/409790938](https://github.com/cast42/cast42.github.io/runs/409790938)
