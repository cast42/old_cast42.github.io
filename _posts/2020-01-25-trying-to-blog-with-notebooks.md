# Trying to blog with notebooks

Today I tried to set up the github pages blog to be able to blog with notebooks.
There's a [notebook](https://github.com/cast42/cast42.github.io/blob/master/_notebooks/2020-01-28-bullet_chart_altair.ipynb) 
in the [_notebooks](https://github.com/cast42/cast42.github.io/blob/master/_notebooks/) directory but I does not generate a post yet.

I keep on debugging.
